This readme describes where you can find my responses to each of the exercises: 

- For the ALS Data Engineer Exercise, you can find my response in a jupyter notebook called, [data_engineer_exercise](https://github.com/als2020/als/blob/master/python/data_engineer_exercises.ipynb). The notebook notes that [people.csv](https://github.com/als2020/als/blob/master/data/people.csv) and [acquisitions_facts.csv](https://github.com/als2020/als/blob/master/data/acquisition_facts.csv) are saved in the [data](https://github.com/als2020/als/tree/master/data) folder of this repo. The data folder does not include the three files that simulate CRM data due to size. The second part of this exercise can be found [here](https://github.com/als2020/als/blob/master/Client_Comms_Data_Engineer.pdf).
- For the analytics exercise, you can find my response [here](https://github.com/als2020/als/blob/master/analytics_results_test.pdf) in a pdf document. The document notes that the [spreadsheet](https://github.com/als2020/als/blob/master/data/spreadsheet.csv) is saved in the [data](https://github.com/als2020/als/tree/master/data) folder. 
- For the email segmentation exercise, you can find my response [here](https://github.com/als2020/als/blob/master/Segmentation_Quality_Assurance_Exercise_2019.docx) in a word document. 
- For the proofing exercise, you can find my response [here](https://github.com/als2020/als/blob/master/Proofing_Exercise_UPDATED_Sept_2017.docx) in a word document which includes track changes.
