This readme describes where you can find my responses to each of the exercises: 

- For the ALS Data Engineer Exercise, you can find my response in a jupyter notebook called, [data_engineer_exercise](../blob/master/python/data_engineer_exercises.ipynb). The notebook notes that people.csv and acquisitions_facts.csv are saved in the data folder of this repo. The data folder does not include the three files that simulate CRM data due to size. The second part of this exercise can be found here.
- For the analytics exercise, you can find my response here in a pdf document. The document notes that the spreadsheet is saved in the data folder. 
- For the email segmentation exercise, you can find my response here in a word document. 
- For the proofing exercise, you can find my response here in a word document which includes track changes.

An ETL exercise:
Please see “ALS Data Engineer Exercise” for detailed instructions on completing the first part of this exercise. We recommend submitting your code by way of a personal GitHub repository.
Please follow the instructions outlined in “Client Comms - Data Engineer” to complete the second part of this exercise: writing an email in a document as if you were sending it to a client.
An analytics exercise:
Please follow the instructions to create a spreadsheet and answer the questions.
An email segmentation exercise:
Please see “Segmentation Quality Assurance exercise” attachments for further instructions here.
A proofing exercise:
Think of the email as if it were sending today.
Please make sure the tracked changes do not include your name or any identifying information. (The best way to shift to "anonymous" for all tracking and/or comments is within the name field in "user information" which is found in "preferences.")
